## Overview

Lab 01 handed you the tools. This lab hands you a problem and gets out of your way.

Somewhere on The Grid, something is down. Your job is not to guess which thing — your job is to **find out**, one rung at a time, and then write down what the evidence says. This is the first time in this course you're being asked to do real diagnostic work rather than follow a recipe, and it is a genuine skill. You already have everything you need.

**The method is the Ladder Rule from Lesson 4:**

1. **Check yourself** — do you have a valid address?
2. **Check your gateway** — can you get out of your own neighbourhood?
3. **Check the target by NAME.**
4. **Check the target by IP.**
5. **Trace the path.**

*Work outward, one rung at a time, and let the evidence pick the culprit.*

The reason the ladder exists is that instinct is a terrible investigator. Instinct wants to name a villain in the first thirty seconds — "it's DNS," "it's the firewall," "it's the router" — and then spend an hour proving itself right. Evidence is slower and it is correct. **Do not decide what is broken until Part E.** Run the rungs in order, record what each one actually said, and let the finding assemble itself.

You will also be told, partway through, what somebody else thinks the problem is. Treat that the way you'd treat any other claim: test it.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) |
| Shell | **bash** throughout this lab |
| Prerequisite | Week 5, Lessons 1–4 completed; Lab 01 completed first (this lab assumes those tools) |
| Commands used | `ip addr`, `ip route`, `ping`, `dig`, `traceroute` |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 5 → CLI Simulator**, and load the **"The Grid — Outage Response (Bash)"** scenario. It boots you into the same workstation you used in Lab 01, on the same segment, with the same gateway. Only one thing about The Grid has changed since yesterday. Find it.

---

## Part A — Establish Your Baseline

Rungs 1 and 2 of the ladder. It is tempting to skip straight to the thing users complained about — resist that. If you don't establish that *your own machine and your own way out are healthy*, then every failure you find afterwards is ambiguous. You won't know whether the target is broken or whether you are.

### Step 1 — Check Yourself

Confirm your workstation still holds a valid address on The Grid, and that you know where its traffic leaves from.

Run `ip addr` for your address, then `ip route` for your gateway — the same two commands you used in Lab 01. (Remember: addresses and routes live in different places, so it takes both.)

The full `ip addr` output:

```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 02:1a:7c:44:0b:5e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.20.5.42/24 brd 10.20.5.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

The full `ip route` output:

```
default via 10.20.5.1 dev eth0
10.20.5.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.20.5.42
```

Your IPv4 address and default gateway, pulled out of those two results:

```
IPv4 address: 10.20.5.42
Default gateway: 10.20.5.1
```

### Step 2 — Check Your Gateway

Ping your default gateway. This is the door out of your neighbourhood — if this fails, nothing past it means anything.

Command you ran:

```
ping 10.20.5.1
```

Output (the full ping result, including the summary line):

```
PING 10.20.5.1 (10.20.5.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from grid-gateway (10.20.5.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.000 ms
64 bytes from grid-gateway (10.20.5.1): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.200 ms
64 bytes from grid-gateway (10.20.5.1): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1.100 ms
64 bytes from grid-gateway (10.20.5.1): icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=1.300 ms

--- 10.20.5.1 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3005ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.000/1.150/1.300/0.100 ms
```

### Step 3 — State What the Baseline Proves

Two healthy results is not "nothing happened." It's a finding, and it eliminates an entire category of causes before you've touched the target once.

What your baseline rules out, and why that matters before you go further:

```
The workstation has a valid address based on running the ip addr command. The ip route command provided the default gateway which is the door out of the neighborhood/network. Running the ping to the default gateway shows that the workstation is able to reach it. So far, there's nothing wrong with the machine which tells you that the problem exists somewhere else. The process of elimination continues as you go to the next step or move further outward.
```

---

## Part B — Test the Target

Rungs 3 and 4. This is the fork in the road, and the two tests must be run **in this order** and read **as a pair**. Either one alone tells you almost nothing. Together they tell you almost everything.

### Step 1 — Test the Target by Name

Ping `relay-station.grid.local` — the host the Foundry staff say they can't reach.

Command you ran:

```
ping relay-station.grid.local
```

Output (the full ping result, including the summary line):

```
PING relay-station.grid.local (10.20.5.30) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- relay-station.grid.local ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 3005ms
```

### Step 2 — Read That Output Carefully Before You Move On

There are two separate things happening in a ping, and this output separates them for you. Look at the **first line**, then look at the **summary line**, and notice that they do not agree about whether things are going well.

Did the name turn into an IP address — and if so, which one? Then: what did the packet loss say?

```
The name turned into an IP address. IP address: 10.20.5.30
There were 4 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss.

```

### Step 3 — Ask DNS Directly

Ping *told* you the name resolved, but it told you in passing, on one line, while it was busy doing something else. Ask the question on its own so the answer is unambiguous — and so you have it in writing when you escalate.

Run `dig relay-station.grid.local`.

Command you ran:

```
dig relay-station.grid.local
```

Output (the full dig result):

```
; <<>> DiG 9.18.24 <<>> relay-station.grid.local
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 41207
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;relay-station.grid.local.			IN	A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
relay-station.grid.local.	3600	IN	A	10.20.5.30

;; Query time: 1 msec
;; SERVER: 10.20.5.10#53(10.20.5.10)
```

Look at the `status:` field in the header and the `ANSWER SECTION`. Does DNS know this host, and if so, what address does it hand back?

What the status field said, and the A record it returned:

```
Yes, DNS knows the host.
status: NOERROR
A record: 10.20.5.30
```

This is the single most quotable piece of evidence in the whole investigation, because it settles a question your colleague is about to raise.

### Step 4 — Test the Target by IP

Now take the IP address out of that first line and ping it directly: `10.20.5.30`. You are deliberately removing name lookup from the equation.

Command you ran:

```
ping 10.20.5.30
```

Output (the full ping result, including the summary line):

```
PING 10.20.5.30 (10.20.5.30) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- 10.20.5.30 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 3005ms
```

### Step 5 — State What the Combination Proves

Now put the two results side by side. The by-name test and the by-IP test each had a job:

- The by-name test asks: *can this name be turned into a number, and does that number answer?*
- The by-IP test asks: *forget names entirely — does that number answer?*

Work through it. If the name failed to become a number, that would point one direction. If the name became a number just fine but the number won't answer, that points somewhere else entirely. And if you removed the name from the equation altogether and the failure **didn't change**, then whatever is broken was never about the name.

What the two tests together prove — and, just as importantly, what they rule out:

```
In this scenario, when you ping by the name (relay-station.grid.local) it does resolve to a number (10.20.5.30); however, there's 100% packet loss. The same results when you ping directly by the number (10.20.5.30), 100% packet loss. The results from both test rules out there being any issues with the name.
```

---

## Part C — Trace the Path

Rung 5. Ping tells you *whether* something answers. Traceroute tells you *how far your traffic got before it stopped* — it lists each hop along the way, and a row of `* * *` means the path died at that point.

One traceroute on its own is hard to read if you've never seen a healthy one. So you'll run two, and compare.

### Step 1 — Trace to the Broken Target

Run `traceroute relay-station.grid.local`.

Command you ran:

```
traceroute relay-station.grid.local
```

Output (the full trace, including the timeout rows):

```
traceroute to relay-station.grid.local (10.20.5.30), 8 hops max, 60 byte packets
  1  grid-gateway (10.20.5.1)  1.000 ms  1.200 ms  1.100 ms
  2  * * *
  3  * * *
  4  * * *
  5  * * *
  6  * * *
  7  * * *
  8  * * *
```

The last hop that answered, and what happened after it:

```
The first hop was the only hop that answered. All seven hops after the first were nonresponsive. 
```

### Step 2 — Trace to a Known-Good Target for Comparison

Now trace to a host you have no reason to suspect — `cloud-heights.grid.local`, out on the far edge of The Grid. (You'll be spending a lot of time in Cloud Heights next week. Consider this an introduction.)

Command you ran:

```
traceroute cloud-heights.grid.local
```

Output (the full trace):

```
traceroute to cloud-heights.grid.local (10.20.7.80), 8 hops max, 60 byte packets
  1  grid-gateway (10.20.5.1)  1.000 ms  1.200 ms  1.100 ms
  2  grid-core (10.20.0.1)  4.000 ms  4.200 ms  4.100 ms
  3  cloud-heights.grid.local (10.20.7.80)  12.000 ms  12.200 ms  12.100 ms
```

The complete list of hops, in order:

```
(1) 10.20.5.1
(2) 10.20.0.1
(3) 10.20.7.80
```

### Step 3 — Compare the Two Traces

The comparison is the whole point of running two. One trace completed and one didn't — and where each one stopped is the evidence.

Pay attention to whether the **first hop** was the same in both. If traffic to the broken target and traffic to the healthy target both got through the same first hop successfully, that tells you something specific about which part of the path is fine.

What the comparison tells you about where the problem is — and where it is not:

```
The first stop is the same stop in both traces (10.20.5.1) which is the default gateway the door out of the community. The ip address for relay-station.grid.local is 10.20.5.30, which means it's on the same street as the workstation (10.20.5.42), just a different house. Why would the first hop for relay-station.grid.local be routed to the default gateway if it's not leaving the neighborhood? So, either the number associated with relay-station.grid.local has changed or there's something wrong with the machine.
```

## Part D — The Colleague's Theory

A more experienced colleague on the on-call channel reads your notes and jumps in:

> "Oh, I've seen this one. It's the relay station's DNS entry — it's `relay-station-old.grid.local` that everything actually points at, and that name is busted. This is a DNS problem, not a host problem. Go check it."

They sound confident. They may even be senior to you. **Test the claim anyway.** In security work, "somebody confident said so" is not evidence, and the fastest way to be respectfully wrong-footed is to accept a theory you could have checked in ten seconds.

### Step 1 — Test the Colleague's Host

Ping `relay-station-old.grid.local`.

Command you ran:

```
ping relay-station-old.grid.local
```

Output (the exact error or result — copy it precisely):

```
ping: relay-station-old.grid.local: Name or service not known
```

### Step 2 — Explain Why This Is a Different Kind of Failure

This result does **not** look like Part B. Compare them closely:

- In Part B, the name became a number, and then the packets went nowhere.
- Here, you never got a number at all.

Those are two genuinely different failures, at two different stages, and confusing them is one of the most common mistakes in network troubleshooting. In Lesson 2 you met the pair: **a name that doesn't resolve at all** versus **a name that resolves perfectly to a host that's dead**. One is the directory not having an entry. The other is the directory being completely correct about an address where nobody answers the door.

For context: `relay-station-old.grid.local` was decommissioned. It was retired on purpose, its directory entry was removed on purpose, and it has nothing to do with today's ticket. A retired name failing to resolve is *expected behaviour*, not an outage.

Explain, in your own words, why this failure is a different kind from the one in Part B — and why it is not the cause of today's outage:

```
The failure that happened in part B with relay-station.grid.local, the name produces a number instantly (10.20.5.3); however, the machine at 10.20.5.3 is just dead. The failure with relay-station-old.grid.local, shows that the name isn't on the board at all. You'll never reach the machine at all because the name no longer exists. The scenario from part B the building is empty but this scenario in Part D the directory doesn't exist at all.
```

### Step 3 — Say How You'd Reply to Your Colleague

You now know they're wrong. Being right is easy; being useful about it is a professional skill. Write the reply you'd actually send — polite, specific, and grounded in what you ran rather than in who's more senior. Point at the evidence, not at the person.

Your reply to your colleague:

```
Hi Tonia, I wanted to follow-up on our conversation from earlier in regard to issues with the host relay-station.grid.local. You stated that you've seen this issue before and that it was a DNS problem, not a host problem. You also suggested that I check relay-station-old.grid.local since the name might be busted. 

Here are the commands that I ran for each and the results I found:

(1) relay-station.grid.local
ping relay-station.grid.local
PING relay-station.grid.local (10.20.5.30) 56(84) bytes of data.
--- relay-station.grid.local ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 3005ms

dig relay-station.grid.local
; <<>> DiG 9.18.24 <<>> relay-station.grid.local
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 41207
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;relay-station.grid.local.			IN	A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
relay-station.grid.local.	3600	IN	A	10.20.5.30

;; Query time: 1 msec
;; SERVER: 10.20.5.10#53(10.20.5.10)

traceroute relay-station.grid.local
traceroute to relay-station.grid.local (10.20.5.30), 8 hops max, 60 byte packets
  1  grid-gateway (10.20.5.1)  1.000 ms  1.200 ms  1.100 ms
  2  * * *
  3  * * *
  4  * * *
  5  * * *
  6  * * *
  7  * * *
  8  * * *

(2) relay-station-old.grid.local
ping relay-station-old.grid.local
ping: relay-station-old.grid.local: Name or service not known

In conclusion, the host relay-station.grid.local produces a number; however, the machine is dead. The name relay-station-old.grid.local is not in the directory at all and is decommissioned. 

Thank you for your assistance with this issue, it's greatly appreciated.
```

### Step 4 — One Control Test Before You Write It Up

You are about to tell people something is broken. Before you do, prove that *not everything* is broken — otherwise the first question you'll be asked is whether the problem is you.

Ping a host you already know is healthy: `foundry-archive.grid.local`.

Command you ran:

```
ping foundry-archive.grid.local
```

Output (the full ping result):

```
PING foundry-archive.grid.local (10.20.5.20) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from foundry-archive.grid.local (10.20.5.20): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=2.000 ms
64 bytes from foundry-archive.grid.local (10.20.5.20): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=2.200 ms
64 bytes from foundry-archive.grid.local (10.20.5.20): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=2.100 ms
64 bytes from foundry-archive.grid.local (10.20.5.20): icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=2.300 ms

--- foundry-archive.grid.local ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3005ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 2.000/2.150/2.300/0.100 ms
```

Why this matters: a report that says "the relay station is unreachable" is weaker than one that says "the relay station is unreachable **while every other host I tested answers normally**." The second version has already ruled out the boring explanations, and it's the difference between a ticket that gets acted on and one that gets handed back to you.

### Step 5 — Capture Your Evidence (REQUIRED screenshot)

Take a screenshot of your simulator session showing your evidence trail — at minimum the failed ping by name, the successful `dig`, the failed ping by IP, and the failed traceroute. **This screenshot is required.** Name it `cli-grid-outage.png`. You'll upload it and record its filename via the GitHub Commit section below.

An incident note with no attached evidence is just an opinion. This is the attachment.

---

## Part E — Write the Finding

This is the part that makes you a security professional rather than someone who can run commands.

Everything you've done so far is raw evidence. Nobody upstream of you — not your team lead, not the Foundry staff who filed the ticket, not the person who picks this up on the next shift — is going to read six terminal outputs and work out the conclusion themselves. Your job is to hand them the conclusion **and** the reason to believe it.

This is your first incident-report rep. You will do many more; Week 12's capstone asks you to write these for real. So we're giving you the structure now, while the stakes are low. Fill in each field — this is not a blank page, it's a form, and every professional incident note answers these same four questions.

**Keep it short and specific.** A good finding is a paragraph, not an essay. Write what you can defend.

### Step 1 — What Is Broken

One or two sentences. Name the specific thing that is not working. Be precise about *what* is down — not "the network," not "the relay station area," but the actual component your evidence points at.

Your statement of what is broken:

```
The host relay-station.grid.local turns into an IP address (10.20.5.30); however, the machine does not respond.
```

### Step 2 — What Evidence Proves It

List the specific tests you ran and what each one returned. This is where your Parts B and C outputs earn their keep. Someone reading this should be able to re-run your tests and reach the same conclusion without asking you a single question.

Your evidence, test by test:

```
(1) relay-station.grid.local
ping relay-station.grid.local
PING relay-station.grid.local (10.20.5.30) 56(84) bytes of data.
--- relay-station.grid.local ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 3005ms

(2) dig relay-station.grid.local
; <<>> DiG 9.18.24 <<>> relay-station.grid.local
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 41207

;; ANSWER SECTION:
relay-station.grid.local.	3600	IN	A	10.20.5.30

;; Query time: 1 msec
;; SERVER: 10.20.5.10#53(10.20.5.10)

(3) traceroute relay-station.grid.local
traceroute to relay-station.grid.local (10.20.5.30), 8 hops max, 60 byte packets
  1  grid-gateway (10.20.5.1)  1.000 ms  1.200 ms  1.100 ms
  2  * * *
  3  * * *
  4  * * *
  5  * * *
  6  * * *
  7  * * *
  8  * * *
```

### Step 3 — What You Ruled Out, and How

Just as important as what you found. Say explicitly which possible causes you eliminated and which specific test eliminated each one. At minimum, address: your own workstation, your local network path out, name resolution, and the colleague's theory.

Ruling out possibilities is what separates a finding from a guess. A reader who sees only your conclusion has to trust you. A reader who sees what you eliminated can *check* you.

What you ruled out and the evidence that ruled it out:

```
The local network path out works just fine and was confirmed by running the command (ping 10.20.5.1). I ruled out my colleague's theory about the name being busted. I pinged the name he suggested was the correct name by running the following command (ping relay-station-old.grid.local), which confirmed the name he suggested didn't even exist. The name produces a number which was confirmed by running the command (ping relay-station.grid.local).
```

### Step 4 — What Should Happen Next

One or two sentences. Based on your finding, who or what needs to be looked at, and by whom? You don't have the access to fix this yourself — and that's normal. Knowing exactly what to escalate, and to whom, is the deliverable.

Your recommended next step:

```
I would recommend checking the machine at ip address 10.20.5.30. There's no response when you ping that ip address, which can mean the device may be offline or completely off.
```

---

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part B you pinged the target by name and then by IP. Explain why running *both* is necessary — describe what a person would wrongly conclude if they had run only the by-name test and stopped there. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
If a person only ran the command to ping by name and stopped there, they could have concluded that something was wrong with the name based on the results. You would have never figured out what the root cause of the issue is because you stop before ruling everything out. It's necessary to run both commands because you want to verify and rule out if it's the name and/or the number.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** A name that returns "Name or service not known" and a name that resolves fine but never replies to a ping are two different failures with two different causes. Describe each one in plain English — what is actually going wrong in each case — and explain why treating them as the same problem would send a troubleshooter down the wrong path. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
A name that returns "Name or service not known" indicates that the directory/name does not exist at all. A name that resolves fine but never replies to a ping means that the machine at that number is just dead (possibly offline). If you treat them as the same problem that can cause a huge problem. Mixing the two failures up can either stop your hunt for the issue prematurely or you can continue digging for something that doesn't exist.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Part A asked you to confirm your own address and your gateway before touching the reported problem at all — even though the ticket had nothing to do with your workstation. Defend that step to a colleague who thinks it's a waste of time on an urgent ticket. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
The protocol is for you to check and make sure you have a valid address first by running ip addr. Then you want to run ip route to determine your gateway address. All information is necessary when you are trying to determine the root cause of an issue. You must first start with yourself and work your way out to determine where the issue lies, so even though this is an urgent ticket all information is pertinent.
```

**Analysis Question 4.** Your colleague was confident, possibly senior, and wrong. Describe how you decided their theory was wrong, and what you think that says about how much weight confidence should carry compared to evidence in security work. Where relevant, consider what would have happened if you had simply accepted their theory and reported it upward. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
The theory from my colleague was tested, and the output from running (ping relay-station-old.grid.local) determined that his theory was not correct. There's nothing wrong with having confidence just make sure your evidence backs up your confidence. If I would have simply accepted my colleague's theory and reported that to my leadership, I probably wouldn't have a job. The theory was easy to verify so a few extra minutes doesn't hurt to check.
```

## GitHub Commit Subsection

This lab's written answers are submitted through the **CyberFoundations Lab Portal**.

1. Go to the CyberFoundations Lab Portal and sign in.
2. Open **Week 5 → Lab 02: The Grid Outage**.
3. Fill in the worksheet fields — they match the commands, outputs, and questions in this file, in the same order.
4. Connect your GitHub account if you haven't already (one-time setup), and select your portfolio repo.
5. Click **Submit to GitHub**. The Portal commits the completed file to `week-05/labs/lab-02-the-grid-outage.md` for you.

**📸 REQUIRED — your evidence screenshot.** Your incident note in Part E needs something to point at:

1. Go to your portfolio repository on GitHub.com and navigate to `assets/screenshots/week-05/` (create the folder if this is your first Week 5 screenshot).
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**, drag in your screenshot, named `cli-grid-outage.png` (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces).
3. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**.
4. Click the uploaded image's filename to open it and confirm your evidence is readable at full size — if the terminal text is too small to read, retake it.
5. Record the filename below so your grader knows to look for it.

The screenshot filename you uploaded:

```
cli-grid-outage.png
```

Your screenshot lives in `assets/screenshots/week-05/` in your repository, alongside the rest of your Week 5 evidence. It does not need to be linked inside this worksheet.

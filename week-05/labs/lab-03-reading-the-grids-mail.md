# Week 5 Lab 03 — Reading the Grid's Mail (Packet Inspector)

**Student Name:** Tiffany Haynes

**Date Completed:** 8/16/2026

**Module:** 2 — Networking & Cloud Foundations | **Week:** 5  
**Submission Path:** `week-05/labs/lab-03-reading-the-grids-mail.md`

## Overview

Lesson 4 showed you the three panes of a packet analyzer — the packet list, the detail pane, and the filter bar — and told you that professionals live in this tool. This lab is where you stop watching and start driving. You'll open a recorded minute of traffic on The Grid and read it packet by packet: a name lookup (Part B), a handshake and the message that followed it (Part C), and one conversation that refuses to be read at all.

**The capture is the same for every student.** It's a recording, not a live network — fifteen packets, captured once, replayed identically for everyone. That means your numbers should match your classmates' exactly. If yours don't, you've filtered something out; clear the filter and look again.

**Nothing here can break anything.** You are reading a recording. There is no traffic to disturb and nothing to configure.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations **Packet Inspector** — browser-based, inside the Lab Portal. Nothing to install. You will never install Wireshark for this course |
| Where to find it | Lab Portal main navigation, alongside the **CLI Simulator** |
| Capture | "The Grid — Workstation Capture." Canned and identical for every student |
| Prerequisite | Week 5, Lesson 3 (ports, the handshake) and Lesson 4 (the three panes) completed. Lab 01 recommended first — Part B builds directly on it |
| Filters available | `dns` · `icmp` · `tcp` · `http` · `ip.addr == x.x.x.x` · `tcp.port == N` |
| Time | Plan for 30–40 minutes, including this worksheet |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 5 → Packet Inspector**, and load the capture named **"The Grid — Workstation Capture."** You should see a list of packets across the top, an empty detail pane below it, and a filter bar above everything. Keep this worksheet open in a second browser tab so you can record answers as you go.

**Get your screenshot tool ready now.** **Windows:** `Win + Shift + S` · **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + 4`, then drag to capture. You'll need it twice in this lab, and both screenshots are required.

**A note on filters:** a filter never deletes packets. It hides the ones that don't match so you can concentrate. Clearing the filter box brings everything back. This matters in Part A — count *before* you filter anything.

---

## Part A — Orientation

### Step 1 — Count the Whole Capture

With the filter bar **empty**, look at the packet list and count how many packets the capture contains. Every packet has a number in the first column, so the last row tells you the answer without counting by hand.

The total number of packets in the capture:

```
There's a total of 15 packets in the capture.
```

### Step 2 — Inventory the Protocols

Scan the **Protocol** column from top to bottom and write down every distinct protocol name you see. There are five. You met all five in Lessons 2, 3 and 4 — this is the first time you're seeing them as labelled traffic rather than as ideas.

The protocols that appear in this capture:

```
DNS, TMP, ICMP, HTTP, TLS
```

### Step 3 — Read the Columns

Four columns do most of the work in a packet analyzer. In your own words — not the Lesson 4 wording — write one plain sentence for each: what does it tell you, and what question does it answer?

What the Source column tells you:

```
The source column tells you the originating destination where the packet was sent from (who sent it).
```

What the Destination column tells you:

```
The destination column tells you where the packet was sent to (Who received it).
```

What the Protocol column tells you:

```
The Protocol column tells you what protocol was used which is an agreement between two machines on who   speaks first or what a valid reply looks like. 
```

What the Info column tells you:

```
The Info column gives you brief summary of what the packet is doing.
```

### Step 4 — Spot Your Own Machine

One address appears more often than any other, and it's the one sending most of the requests. That's the workstation the capture was taken from — the same address you recorded in Lab 01.

The workstation's IP address, and how you worked out it was the workstation:

```
10.5.20.42
I was able to determine it was the workstation's IP address since I recognized the number and on the very first row under the info column the name associated with the IP address was mentioned.
```

---

## Part B — Follow a DNS Lookup

In Lab 01 you ran `dig foundry-archive.grid.local` and read a tidy answer: a name went in, an IP address came out. You saw the *result*. Now you're going to see the actual conversation that produced it — the question travelling across the wire and the answer coming back.

### Step 1 — Filter for DNS

Type `dns` into the filter bar and apply it. The packet list shrinks to the name-lookup traffic only.

The packet numbers that remain after the `dns` filter:

```
Packet numbers 1 & 2 remain after the dns filter is applied.
```

### Step 2 — Read the Question

Click the first of your two DNS packets and read its Info column and detail pane. This is the query — your workstation asking the Directory Board a question.

The packet number of the query, and the name being asked about:

```
Packet 1, foundry-archive.grid.local
```

The source and destination addresses of the query — who asked, and who was asked:

```
Source: 10.20.5.42 (who asked)
Destination: 10.20.5.10 (who was asked)
```

### Step 3 — Read the Answer

Now click the second DNS packet. This is the response coming back the other way.

The packet number of the response, and the IP address it returned:

```
Packet 2, The IP address it returned was 10.20.5.20
```

### Step 4 — Find the Door

DNS doesn't just travel to an address — it travels to a specific **port** on that address, the way Lesson 3 described a numbered door on a building. Open the detail pane on either DNS packet and find the port number the lookup used.

The port number DNS used here:

```
Port 53
```

### Step 5 — Tie It Back to Lab 01

This is the same lookup you ran with `dig` in Lab 01 — same name, same answer, same DNS server. The difference is the altitude you're viewing it from. `dig` handed you the conclusion; the Packet Inspector shows you the two messages that produced it.

In two or three sentences: what did the packet view show you that `dig` did not?

```
One thing that the packet details show you that the command dig does not is the source's port number. The packet detail also shows you flags which is under the DNS Query section. The final thing that the packet view provided is the IPv4 protocol which is not provided by the dig command. 
```

### Step 6 — Capture Screenshot 1 (REQUIRED)

With the `dns` filter still applied and one of the two DNS packets selected, take a screenshot showing the filter bar, the filtered packet list, and the detail pane. Name it exactly **`packet-dns-query.png`**. Upload instructions are in the GitHub Commit section.

## Part C — Doors and the Handshake

Lesson 3 told the TCP handshake as a knock at a door: **SYN** ("knock"), **SYN-ACK** ("who's there — come in"), **ACK** ("thanks"). You're about to watch one happen.

### Step 1 — Filter for Port 443

Clear the `dns` filter and enter `tcp.port == 443` instead. Port 443 is HTTPS — one of the well-known doors from Lesson 3.

The packet numbers that remain after the `tcp.port == 443` filter:

```
Packets 7, 8, 9 & 10 remain after applying the tcp.port == 443 filter.
```

### Step 2 — Identify the Three-Step Handshake

Three of those packets are the handshake itself. Find each one by reading the flags in the Info column, and record its number, its direction (which address sent it to which), and which step of the handshake it is.

The SYN — packet number and direction:

```
Packet 7, From 10.20.5.42 to 10.20.5.20, The SYN
```

The SYN-ACK — packet number and direction:

```
Packet 8, From 10.20.5.20 to 10.20.5.42, The SYN-ACK
```

The ACK — packet number and direction:

```
Packet 9, From 10.20.5.42 to 10.20.5.20, The ACK
```

### Step 3 — Notice the Two Port Numbers

Look at the Info column on the SYN packet. Two port numbers appear: a high, odd-looking one on your workstation's side, and 443 on the server's side. Only one of them is a "well-known door" — the other is a temporary one your machine picked for this conversation.

The two port numbers, and which belongs to the server:

```
Workstation: Port 51514
Server: Port 443
```

### Step 4 — Switch to the Plain Conversation

Clear the filter and enter `http` instead. This is a different conversation to a different machine on The Grid — the notice board — on port 80.

The packet numbers that remain after the `http` filter:

```
The packets that remain after the http filter are 14 and 15.
```

### Step 5 — Open the Request and Read It

Click **packet 14** and expand its detail pane all the way. Unlike everything you've read so far, this packet's contents are ordinary text — you can simply read them, the way you'd read a note left on a desk.

The request line at the top of packet 14 (the method, the page, and the version):

```
Method: GET 
Page: shift-notice.html 
Version: HTTP/1.1
```

The Host line — which machine the request was addressed to:

```
Host: grid-notice.grid.local
```

Every other readable line in packet 14's detail pane:

```
User-Agent: GridBrowser/2.4
X-Staff-Code: FOUNDRY-2026-STOREROOM
```

### Step 6 — Notice What You Just Read

One of those lines is not like the others. It carries a value that looks like an internal code rather than a technical setting.

The name of that header and the exact value it carries:

```
X-Staff-Code: Foundry-2026-Storeroom
```

In one or two sentences: if you were sitting on this network with a packet analyzer open, what would you now know that you were never meant to know?

```
If I were sitting on the network with a packet analyzer open, I would have found out an internal code for the X-staff which was Foundry-2026-storeroom.
```

### Step 7 — Capture Screenshot 2 (REQUIRED)

With the `http` filter applied and **packet 14** selected and expanded so the readable lines are visible, take a screenshot. Name it exactly **`packet-http-plaintext.png`**.

### Step 8 — Now Try to Read the Other One

Clear the filter and click **packet 10** — the TLS Client Hello from the port 443 conversation you examined in Steps 1–3. Expand its detail pane and try to read it the same way you just read packet 14.

What packet 10's detail pane shows you, described in your own words:

```
Packet 10's detail pane shows you a scrambled encrypted version of the real message. 
```

Compare it to packet 14 — what can you still tell about packet 10 from the packet list, even though you can't read its contents?

```
I can tell that port/door 443 was used for packet 10 because the message is encrypted or unreadable and port 80 was used for the message in packet 14 since you can plainly read the contents.

```

**Don't chase this yet.** You've just found something real, and the explanation is a later part of this course. For now, sit with the observation: two conversations, one legible and one not. Analysis Question 4 asks what you make of it.

---

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part A you counted the packets before applying any filter. Explain why a filter is a *view* rather than a deletion, and describe a situation where forgetting that could lead an analyst to a wrong conclusion. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
A filter is a view rather than a deletion because it just narrows down what you're searching for. For example, if you are searching for everything that had the protocol http then the view would only show packets that match that criteria, everything else would temporarily disappear. You may have thousands of packets in an analyzer and if you filter by specific criteria and forget, then you may come to the conclusion that you've deleted all of that information.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** You have now seen the same DNS lookup twice — once as `dig` output in Lab 01, once as two packets here. Describe what each view is good for, and name one investigation where you would specifically want the packet view. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
If you're only looking to confirm the IP address associated with a name and which server provided that answer, then the dig command would be the best. The view with the 2 packets gave more details than you would get just running the dig command. You get to see the sequence of how the information was sent, the source and destination address for both, you may get to see the packet contents if it's not encrypted. I think one investigation where you would want the packet view is when there's 100% packet loss or Failure 2 from lesson 2 where the building was empty.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** The handshake took three packets and about three milliseconds before a single byte of real content moved. Using the knock-at-the-door analogy from Lesson 3, explain what those three packets accomplish and why a connection would be less reliable without them. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
1) Syn- Hello, I'd like to start a conversation. This is the knock at the door.
2) Syn-Ack- Who's there, Come in. 
3) Ack- Thanks
A connection would be less reliable without the three handshake steps because the first thing it verifies is that there is a live machine and if the receiving machine is ready to accept the packet, then how would you know if you can send any data.
```

**Analysis Question 4.** You read packet 14 word for word, and packet 10 not at all — same capture, same network, same workstation. What do you think explains the difference between them? And why does it matter that the one you *could* read contained a staff code? You are not expected to know the mechanism yet; give us your best reasoning from what you observed. *(Minimum 4 sentences.)*

```
The difference between the two packets is the ports that were used to transport the messages. Packet 14 used http which correlates to port 80. Everything is visible to anyone along the path to see what's being sent. Being able to see that staff code is a vulnerability.  Packet 10 used https which correlates to port 443 and everything sent via this port is encrypted/secure. You're not able to view messages that are encrypted.
```

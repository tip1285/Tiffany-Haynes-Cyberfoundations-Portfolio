# Week 5 Stretch Lab (OPTIONAL) — The Real Grid

**Student Name:** Tiffany Haynes

**Date Completed:** 8/16/2026

**Module:** 2 — Networking & Cloud Foundations | **Week:** 5  
**Submission Path:** `week-05/labs/lab-04-stretch-the-real-grid.md`

---

## Overview

Everything you've done this week ran inside The Grid — a network built to behave predictably so you could learn to read it. This stretch lab points the same four questions at a network nobody designed for teaching: your own. You'll find your real address (Part A), trace a path across the actual internet (Part B), look up a name that answers with more than one number (Part C), and then do the step that matters most professionally — decide what is safe to publish before you commit anything (Part D).

**This lab is optional, and it is rated when you submit it.** If you complete it, it's read and scored like any other lab and it strengthens your portfolio.

**Skipping it costs you nothing.** Your grade for Week 5 comes from Labs 01, 02 and 03 — those three are the graded path and they are complete on their own. A locked-down work laptop that blocks the terminal, a Chromebook, a shared family computer you'd rather not photograph, a machine you don't administer — all of these are perfectly legitimate reasons not to run this lab, and none of them says anything about you as a student. Choose freely.

**Built-in commands only.** Every command in this lab already exists on your computer. **You will not install anything** — not for this lab, not for this program. If any instruction anywhere seems to ask you to install software, stop and ask your instructor; that instruction is wrong.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | Your own computer, Windows or macOS. Nothing to install, ever |
| What you'll open | **Windows:** Command Prompt (`cmd`) or PowerShell — press `Win`, type `cmd`, press Enter · **macOS:** Terminal — press `Cmd + Space`, type `terminal`, press Enter |
| Prerequisite | Week 5 Lessons 1, 2 and 4; Labs 01 and 02 completed first |
| Status | **Optional. Rated when submitted.** The three core labs are the graded path |
| Time | Plan for 30–45 minutes, including redaction |

**Linux users:** the macOS column works for you with one exception — `traceroute` may not be present on every distribution. If it isn't, use `tracepath` if you already have it, or skip Part B and say so. Do not install anything.

---

## The Command Table — Read This Before You Start

Your operating system decides which command you type. Find your column and stay in it.

| Goal | Windows | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Your address | `ipconfig` | `ifconfig` or `ipconfig getifaddr en0` |
| Reachability | `ping -n 4 HOST` | `ping -c 4 HOST` |
| Trace the path | `tracert HOST` | `traceroute HOST` |
| Name lookup | `nslookup HOST` | `dig HOST` or `nslookup HOST` |

Replace `HOST` with the name or address you're testing.

**Windows has no `dig`.** It's a real command and a good one, but it does not ship with Windows — you used it in the CLI Simulator, which runs a Linux-style shell. On Windows, `nslookup` is the built-in equivalent and it answers the same question. **Do not install `dig`, or the BIND tools that contain it, to get around this.**

Two more differences worth knowing:
- **`ping` runs forever on macOS/Linux unless you stop it.** That's what `-c 4` is for — "send four and stop." Windows sends four by default; `-n 4` makes it explicit. If a ping ever won't stop, press `Ctrl + C`.
- **The trace command is spelled differently on each platform**: `tracert` on Windows (no "u"), `traceroute` on macOS. Same idea, same output shape.

---

## Part A — Your Real Address

### Step 1 — Ask Your Machine Where It Lives

Open your terminal and run the address command from your column. On macOS, `ipconfig getifaddr en0` gives you one clean line; plain `ifconfig` gives you everything, which is messier but more honest about what's really there.

The command you ran:

```
ipconfig
```

### Step 2 — Find Your IPv4 Address and Gateway

Somewhere in that output is a four-part number like `192.168.1.something` or `10.0.0.something` — your IPv4 address on your local network. Nearby you should find a **default gateway** (Windows labels it plainly; on macOS you may need to look at your Wi-Fi settings instead, which is fine).

Your IPv4 address and, if you can find it, your default gateway:

```
IPv4 address: 192.168.1.166
Default gateway: 192.168.1.1
```

### Step 3 — Compare It With The Grid

In the simulator, your address was `10.20.5.42` — one adapter, one address, one gateway, perfectly tidy. Your real output is probably not tidy. Most machines show several network adapters (Wi-Fi and Ethernet, often both listed even when only one is connected), plus things like a VPN adapter, a virtual adapter from other software, and long IPv6 addresses full of colons alongside the IPv4 ones.

That mess is normal. Real machines wear several address plates at once.

What your real output has that the simulator's didn't — list what you see:

```
Ethernet Adapter, Wireless Lan adapter Local Area Connection 1 & 2, IPv6 Address, Temporary IPv6 Address, Link-Local IPv6 Address, Ethernet adapter Bluetooth Network connection
```

Which of the addresses you found is the one your computer actually uses to reach the internet, and how did you decide?

```
The default gateway (192.168.1.1) is the address my computer uses to reach the internet. The default gateway is the door out of the local network so it forwards traffic that is meant for any network other my local network.
```

### Step 4 — Private or Public?

Lesson 1 covered private address ranges — `10.x.x.x`, `172.16–31.x.x`, and `192.168.x.x` are *inside* addresses, used on local networks everywhere and never routed across the internet directly.

Does your IPv4 address fall in a private range, and what does that tell you about how your machine reaches the outside world?

```
My IPv4 address (192.168.1.166) falls into the private range. That means my machine has two addresses: (1) The first address faces inward at my device (private) and (2) The second faces outward at the internet.
```

---

## Part B — Trace Into the Real World

### Step 1 — Trace to a Distant Host

Pick one well-known, distant host and trace the path to it. Any of these work: `wikipedia.org`, `bbc.co.uk`, `cloudflare.com`, `example.com`. Pick one that's geographically far from you if you can — the distance is the point.

Run the trace command from your column. **Be patient:** a real traceroute can take a minute or more, because every hop that doesn't answer has to time out before the trace moves on.

The command you ran, including the host you chose:

```
tracert wikipedia.org
```

### Step 2 — Count the Hops

Each numbered line is one router your traffic passed through on its way. In the simulator, `cloud-heights.grid.local` was three hops away. The real internet is deeper than that.

The number of hops your trace showed:

```
13 hops
```

The first hop's address — and one sentence on what that device is:

```
The address for the first hop is syn-2603-6080-4df0-c880-0000-0000-0000-0001.res6.spectrum.com and that would be on my home router.
```

### Step 3 — Watch the Latency Climb

Each hop reports a round-trip time in milliseconds. Early hops (your own router, your ISP) are usually very fast. Later hops, further away, are slower — because the data is physically travelling further and passing through more equipment.

The round-trip time at your first hop, and at your last hop:

```
First hop: 3ms, 2ms, 2ms
Last hop: 40ms, 34ms, 35ms
```

In two or three sentences: describe the pattern you see, and say what it suggests about the physical distance the data covered.

```
The pattern I see is the more hops the longer the rtt. It suggests that the hops were taken further out from the machine that made the original request.
```

### Step 4 — About Those Stars

You will almost certainly see lines that look like this:

```
 7   * * *   Request timed out.
```

**This is completely normal and it is not an error.** Plenty of routers on the internet are configured not to reply to trace requests — sometimes for security reasons, sometimes just because their operator saw no reason to answer. Your packets still passed through those routers perfectly well; the router simply declined to say hello on the way past.

**A trace that ends in a run of stars has not failed.** It very often means the destination's own network doesn't answer traces, even though the site loads fine in your browser. Nothing on your machine is broken, you didn't type it wrong, and you don't need to try again with a different host.

> **Wait — didn't stars mean something was broken?**
>
> In Lab 02 you saw `* * *` immediately after the gateway and concluded the relay station was down. Here you'll see stars too, and nothing is wrong. The difference isn't the stars — it's **whether the trace keeps going**.
>
> A few starred hops in the middle of a trace that then *continues* and *arrives* means some router along the way politely declined to answer the probe. Your traffic went straight through it. That's ordinary internet behaviour and most real traces have it.
>
> Stars that start early and run all the way to the end, with the trace **never arriving**, are the Lab 02 pattern — the path stops being visible and nothing at the far end ever answers.
>
> Same symbol, two very different stories. Reading which one you're looking at is the actual skill.

Whether your trace showed any `* * *` lines, and roughly where:

```
My trace showed stars at the 5th, 7th, 8th and 12th hop.
```

In one or two sentences: what do those stars tell you, and what do they specifically *not* tell you?

```
The stars tell me that that particular network probably doesn't respond to trace requests. The stars don't tell me if something really is broken. 
```

### Step 5 — Capture Your Screenshot (REQUIRED if you submit this lab)

Take a screenshot of your traceroute output. Name it exactly **`stretch-real-traceroute.png`**.

**Do not upload it yet.** Part D is where you make it safe to publish, and Part D is not optional.

---

## Part C — One Name, Many Numbers

### Step 1 — Look Up a Large Website

Use the name lookup command from your column against a big, busy website — `google.com`, `amazon.com`, `wikipedia.org` and `cloudflare.com` all work well. Windows students: this is `nslookup`.

The command you ran and the name you looked up:

```
nslookup amazon.com
```

### Step 2 — Count the Answers

In Lab 01, `foundry-archive.grid.local` gave you exactly one address: `10.20.5.20`. One name, one number, clean. Real large sites usually don't behave that way.

How many addresses came back, and what they were:

```
Addresses: 98.82.161.185
          98.87.170.74
          98.87.170.71
```

### Step 3 — Reason About Why

A single name answering with several different addresses is deliberate engineering, not a glitch. Think about what a service like Google or Amazon has to handle: millions of people at once, spread across the world, and equipment that occasionally fails or needs maintenance.

Why would a very large service want one name to answer with several addresses? Give at least two distinct reasons.

```
I would think if you got people spread all across the world using the same website, maybe the company wants to ensure that latency is not an issue. To prevent any latency issues, people from different regions have a different IP addresses based on the location, but it goes to the same website. For maintenance purposes, the extra websites are probably used temporarily when the main website is down for maintenance.
```

### Step 4 — Try It Again

Run the exact same lookup a second time, and compare.

Whether the addresses changed, stayed the same, or came back in a different order:

```
The second produced the same IP addresses; however, they were in a different order.
```

## Part D — Redaction (REQUIRED — do not skip this)

Everything you've run so far describes your actual home. Your terminal output can contain your **public IP address** (which maps to roughly where you live and who your internet provider is), your **computer's hostname** (which is very often your real name — `marias-macbook-pro`), the **username in your shell prompt**, and your **ISP's name** in traceroute hostnames.

You are about to publish this to a public GitHub repository that employers will read.

**This is not paranoia — it is the job.** Security professionals write reports, file tickets, post screenshots in chat, and present findings constantly, and every single time they make one judgement first: *what in this evidence is safe to share, and what has to be covered?* Get it wrong in a real incident report and you leak your client's infrastructure to whoever reads it. Practising that judgement here, on your own data, where the stakes are zero, is how you build the reflex before it counts.

**Redaction is a graded part of this lab.** An unredacted public IP or hostname in a committed screenshot comes back for correction every time.

### Step 1 — Find What Needs Covering

Look carefully at your screenshot from Part B, Step 5 and at anything you plan to paste into this worksheet. Hunt for these four things specifically:

1. **Your public IP address** — the address the outside world sees you as. It often appears as an early hop in a traceroute, and it is not a private `10.x` / `192.168.x` address.
2. **Your computer's hostname** — check your terminal's title bar and window title, not just the command output. This is where real names hide.
3. **The username in your shell prompt** — the text before the `$` or `>` on every line, e.g. `maria@marias-macbook ~ %`.
4. **Any ISP name** — real traceroute hops carry hostnames like `cust-73-42-19-8.yourisp.net`, which name your provider and sometimes your city.

What you found in your own output that needs covering — list each item:

```
ISP name and computer's root folder
```

### Step 2 — Cover It Properly

Two methods, both built into your operating system. **You are not installing an editing tool for this.**

**Crop it.** The simplest and safest option. If the sensitive lines are at the top or bottom, just cut them off — cropped pixels are gone, not hidden.
- **macOS:** open the image in **Preview**, drag a box around the part you want to keep, then `Tools → Crop`.
- **Windows:** open it in **Photos** or **Paint**, use **Crop**, keep the region you want.

**Or draw a solid filled box over it.**
- **macOS Preview:** `Tools → Annotate → Rectangle`, then use the **fill colour** control to make it a *solid* colour — black is fine. A rectangle with no fill is just an outline around your data.
- **Windows Snip & Sketch / Paint:** choose the filled-rectangle shape, set the fill to a solid colour, and draw it over the text.

**⚠️ Do not blur, pixelate, or use a marker-pen highlight.** Blurring and pixelation transform the original pixels rather than replacing them, and there are well-known techniques for reversing them and recovering the original text — this has burned real professionals in published reports. A **solid, opaque box** contains no information about what was underneath it. Cropping is even better, because the data is simply not in the file.

**Also check:** semi-transparent boxes (drag the opacity slider to full), and boxes that don't quite cover the last character.

Which method you used and what you covered:

```
I drew a box over the text and filled it with the color black. Then I went on top of the black and used the color white.
```

### Step 3 — Re-Read Your Own Worksheet

Screenshots aren't the only leak. Scroll back through the answers you typed in Parts A, B and C and check the *text* too — a pasted traceroute in Part B or an address in Part A can carry exactly the same information.

Where a private local address like `192.168.1.14` is fine to publish (it means nothing outside your house, and millions of people have the same one), a **public** IP is not.

What you changed in your typed answers, if anything:

```
Nothing needed changing
```

### Step 4 — Pre-Flight Checklist

Tick every line before you upload anything. If you can't tick one, fix it first.

- [x] My public IP address does not appear in the screenshot

- [x] My public IP address does not appear in any answer I typed

- [x] My computer's hostname is not visible — including in the terminal's title bar

- [x] My username is not visible in the shell prompt

- [x] My ISP's name does not appear in any hop hostname

- [x] Every redaction is a **solid filled box or a crop** — no blur, no pixelation, no outline-only rectangle, no partial transparency

- [x] I opened the final image full size and looked at it once more, edge to edge

- [x] I would be comfortable with this image being visible to anyone on the internet, forever

That last line is the real test. A public repository is public, and it is permanent.

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** Compare the simulator's network to your real one. Name two specific ways your real output was messier or more complicated than `10.20.5.42`, and explain why a teaching environment is built tidy in the first place. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
My real output was messier than the simulator's output because my computer uses the Windows command prompt and the simulator used bash (Linux). There was a lot more information provided when running the commands on my real computer than when the commands were executed in the simulator. The teaching environment should be tidy so that you can see things on a much smaller scale before seeing things in a real situation. 
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Your traceroute crossed routers belonging to organisations you've never heard of, and some of them refused to identify themselves. Using what you saw in Part B, explain what a traceroute can and cannot tell you — and why `* * *` is not evidence that anything is broken. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
The traceroute can tell me how long it takes to travel between each hop before reaching the final destination. Whenever there are stars present and not an actual rtt, that can be an indication that the router doesn't respond to trace requests. Stars are not evidence that something is broken because you can still complete the trace request with stars at some of the hops. 
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Part D asked you to decide what was safe to publish. Walk through your own judgement: what did you choose to hide, what did you judge safe to leave visible, and how did you decide where the line was? Name one thing you deliberately left in and explain why it was safe. *(Minimum 4 sentences.)*

```
The only thing I decided to hide was the first two lines/hops which showed an IP address associated with my service provider and a root folder on my computer. Everything else on the screen was safe to publish. Nothing on the screenshot showed my personal username, computer's host name or public IP address. The information I left visible was information that anyone can access, so it wasn't any personal info. I left the IP address to show the path of the hops and the rtt so you can see the time between each hop.
```

## GitHub Commit Subsection

Submit this lab exactly like the three core labs — through the **CyberFoundations Lab Portal**.

1. Go to the CyberFoundations Lab Portal and sign in.
2. Open **Week 5 → Stretch Lab: The Real Grid**.
3. Fill in the worksheet fields — they match the steps and questions in this file.
4. Connect your GitHub account if you haven't already (one-time setup), and select your portfolio repo.
5. Click **Submit to GitHub**. The Portal commits the completed file to `week-05/labs/lab-04-stretch-the-real-grid.md` for you.

**📸 Your screenshot — redacted first.** Do not start these steps until every line of the Part D pre-flight checklist is ticked. Once an image is committed to a public repository, deleting it later does not reliably remove it from the history.

1. Go to your portfolio repository on GitHub.com and navigate to `assets/screenshots/week-05/`.
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**, drag in your **redacted** screenshot, named `stretch-real-traceroute.png` (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces).
3. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**.
4. Click the uploaded image's filename to open it — the image itself will display on the page.
5. **Look at it one final time, full size, on GitHub.** This is your last checkpoint before it's public. If anything sensitive survived, delete the file and re-upload a corrected version now.
6. Record the filename below so your grader knows to look for it.

The screenshot filename you uploaded:

```
stretch-real-traceroute.png
```

Your screenshot lives in `assets/screenshots/week-05/` in your repository. It does not need to be linked inside this worksheet.

**Commit message tip:** *"Add Week 5 stretch lab — real-network trace, redacted"* tells a reader both what you did and that you thought about disclosure. That second half is the part hiring managers notice.

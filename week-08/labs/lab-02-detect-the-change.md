# Week 8 Lab 02 — Detect the Change

**Student Name:** Tiffany Haynes

**Date Completed:** September 13, 2026

**Module:** 3 — Practical Cryptography  
**Submission Path:** `week-08/labs/lab-02-detect-the-change.md`

> ## STOP — Protect secrets
> Never paste, upload, commit, or screenshot a password, passphrase, or private key. Do not run `cat` on any private-key file. Submit only the worksheet and the named screenshots. Keep all cryptographic files on the VM.

## How to Use This Lab

- **[TERMINAL]** means type or paste the command into the Cloud Heights terminal.
- **[WORKSHEET]** means type your response in this lab worksheet.
- Run commands in the order shown. Do not type the sample output.
- If your result does not match the stated success check, stop at the Troubleshooting box. Do not improvise with `sudo`, package installation, Azure settings, or SSH server configuration.

## Mission

Create a SHA-256 fingerprint of the original report, change a copy, and prove that the changed copy has a different fingerprint.

## What You Already Know

A cryptographic hash produces a fixed-length digest. Hashing does not hide content and has no decrypt step. A mismatch proves the two inputs differ; it does not identify who made the change.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
whoami
cf-week8-check
cd ~/cloud-heights/week8-cryptography
test -f evidence/incident-report.txt && echo "READY: starting file exists"
```

**Continue only if:** `whoami` prints `analyst`, all checks report `PASS`, and the final line is `READY: starting file exists`.

### If the VM Stops

Return to **My Lab Environment** in the Lab Portal and start your assigned VM. A stopped or deallocated VM is not deleted; saved disk files remain.

## Predict First

**[WORKSHEET]** If one line is added to a file, will its SHA-256 digest remain the same? Explain.

```text
If one line is added to a file, then its SHA-256 digest will not remain the same. The file has completely changed; therefore, a new SHA-256 digest will change as well or create a new fingerprint.
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Hash the Original

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
sha256sum evidence/incident-report.txt | tee hashes/original.sha256
```

**Expected result:** A 64-character hexadecimal digest followed by the original filename.

### Step 2 — Create and Change a Copy

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
cp evidence/incident-report.txt hashes/incident-report-modified.txt
echo "Review Note: Integrity validation exercise completed." >> hashes/incident-report-modified.txt
tail -n 3 hashes/incident-report-modified.txt
```

**Expected result:** The added `Review Note` appears in the last three lines. The original file was not changed.

### Step 3 — Hash the Changed Copy

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
sha256sum hashes/incident-report-modified.txt | tee hashes/modified.sha256
```

### Step 4 — Compare the Digest Values

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
ORIGINAL_HASH=$(cut -d' ' -f1 hashes/original.sha256)
MODIFIED_HASH=$(cut -d' ' -f1 hashes/modified.sha256)
printf 'ORIGINAL: %s
MODIFIED: %s
' "$ORIGINAL_HASH" "$MODIFIED_HASH"
if [ "$ORIGINAL_HASH" = "$MODIFIED_HASH" ]; then
  echo "UNEXPECTED: hashes match — stop and troubleshoot"
else
  echo "EXPECTED: hashes differ because the file changed"
fi
```

**Required result:** Two different digest values and `EXPECTED: hashes differ because the file changed`.

**Evidence moment:** Capture the terminal now as `week08-lab02-sha256-comparison.png`.

## Stop & Check

If you see `UNEXPECTED`, do not submit.

### Troubleshooting

Run `tail -n 3 hashes/incident-report-modified.txt`. If the Review Note is missing, repeat Step 2 once, then repeat Steps 3–4. Do not edit the original file.

## Explain

**[WORKSHEET]** In 3–4 sentences, state what the mismatch proves and two things it does not prove.

```text
The mismatch proves that the two documents do not match. The mismatch should prompt an investigation.  The mismatch does not prove who changed the document or file, and it doesn't prove what information was changed. 
```

## Analysis Questions

1. What does the different SHA-256 value prove?

```text
The different SHA-256 value proves that the original data has been altered or modified. The integrity of the original file or data no longer exists.
```

2. Why does the mismatch not identify the person who changed the file?

```text
A mismatch is generated only when the integrity of a file has changed, so that means it only confirms whether or not data was modified or altered. A mismatch would not identify who changed the file since it does not confirm who has access to a file.
```

3. Why does hashing not protect confidentiality?

```text
A hash is not encrypted data. There is no key and no decrypt step. The digest cannot be reversed into the original input. Encryption protects the confidentiality of a file and hashing deals with the integrity of a file. Hashing is a one-way cryptographic function that tells us whether or not data is in its original trusted state. 
```

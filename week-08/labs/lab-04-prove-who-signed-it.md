> ## STOP — Protect secrets
> Never paste, upload, commit, or screenshot a password, passphrase, or private key. Do not run `cat` on any private-key file. Submit only the worksheet and the named screenshots. Keep all cryptographic files on the VM.

## How to Use This Lab

- **[TERMINAL]** means type or paste the command into the Cloud Heights terminal.
- **[WORKSHEET]** means type your response in this lab worksheet.
- Run commands in the order shown. Do not type the sample output.
- If your result does not match the stated success check, stop at the Troubleshooting box. Do not improvise with `sudo`, package installation, Azure settings, or SSH server configuration.

## Mission

Create a separate signing key pair, sign the incident report, verify the original, then prove that the same signature fails against a changed copy.

## What You Already Know

A digital signature uses a private key to sign and the matching public key to verify. Verification supports integrity and authenticity claims about the key. It does not encrypt the report or prove which human physically used the private key.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
whoami
cf-week8-check
cd ~/cloud-heights/week8-cryptography
test ! -e keys/week8_signing_private.pem &&   test ! -e keys/week8_signing_public.pem &&   echo "READY: signing-key paths are unused" ||   echo "STOP: signing-key file already exists"
```

**Continue only if:** `whoami` prints `analyst`, all checks report `PASS`, and the final line begins with `READY`.

If it begins with `STOP`, do not overwrite or delete anything. Ask the instructor whether to resume or reset.

### If the VM Stops

Return to **My Lab Environment** in the Lab Portal and start your assigned VM. A stopped or deallocated VM is not deleted; saved disk files remain.

## Predict First

**[WORKSHEET]** Should the original signature verify after the report content changes? Explain.

```text
The original signature will not verify the report after the content changes. In the notary analogy, the notary verifies your identity first. Once the document is signed, a seal is applied that shows if the content is ever opened or modified later. In this scenario, if the report content changes then it's no longer the original report; therefore, the original signature will not verify it.
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Generate the Private Signing Key

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
openssl genpkey   -algorithm RSA   -aes-256-cbc   -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048   -out keys/week8_signing_private.pem
```

Create one **signing-key passphrase** when prompted. You will use this same passphrase in Steps 2 and 4. Do not record or screenshot it.

### Step 2 — Derive the Public Key

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
openssl pkey   -in keys/week8_signing_private.pem   -pubout   -out keys/week8_signing_public.pem
```

Enter the signing-key passphrase from Step 1.

### Step 3 — Confirm Both Files Exist

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
ls -l keys/week8_signing_private.pem keys/week8_signing_public.pem
```

Do not display the private-key contents.

### Step 4 — Sign the Original Report

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
openssl dgst -sha256   -sign keys/week8_signing_private.pem   -out signatures/incident-report.sig   evidence/incident-report.txt
```

Enter the signing-key passphrase from Step 1.

### Step 5 — Verify the Original Report

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
openssl dgst -sha256   -verify keys/week8_signing_public.pem   -signature signatures/incident-report.sig   evidence/incident-report.txt
```

**Required result:** `Verified OK`

**Evidence moment:** Capture this result as `week08-lab04-signature-valid.png`.

### Step 6 — Change a Copy

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
cp evidence/incident-report.txt signatures/incident-report-modified.txt
echo "Change: post-signature modification." >> signatures/incident-report-modified.txt
```

### Step 7 — Test the Original Signature Against the Changed Copy

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
openssl dgst -sha256   -verify keys/week8_signing_public.pem   -signature signatures/incident-report.sig   signatures/incident-report-modified.txt
```

**Required result:** `Verification failure`. Additional OpenSSL error lines are normal for this intentional failure.

**Evidence moment:** Capture this result as `week08-lab04-signature-invalid-after-change.png`.

## Stop & Check

Do not create the changed copy until Step 5 returns `Verified OK`.

### Troubleshooting

- Step 2 or 4 cannot read the private key: re-enter the Step 1 signing-key passphrase.
- Step 5 reports failure: confirm you used the original report, public key, and signature paths exactly as shown.
- Step 7 reports `Verified OK`: run `tail -n 2 signatures/incident-report-modified.txt`. If the Change line is missing, repeat Step 6 once and rerun Step 7.

## Explain

**[WORKSHEET]** In 4–5 sentences, explain both verification results and why signing is not encryption.

```text
The verification results from #5 produced the results Verified OK, which means that the file was signed with the private key, verified by the public key and everything matches. The results from #7 produced the results Verification failure, which means the document was signed with the private key, verified by the public key but the content was changed. Signing a document does not encrypt it or hide its contents from others. Integrity and authenticity are the goals of digitally signing a document.
```

## Analysis Questions

1. What does `Verified OK` establish within this lab?

```text
The Verified OK, which means that the file was signed with the private key, verified by the public key and everything matches (no changes).
```

2. Why did the changed copy fail verification?

```text
During the verification process the public key is used to check the signature and confirm that the content is unchanged. If the content changes, then the verification fails which is why the changed copy failed verification. Even one altered character produces an invalid result. The failure is the integrity guarantee. 
```

3. Why is the signed report still readable?

```text
The signed report is still readable because signing does not hide the contents of the report, encryption does. Signing adds a verifiable stamp; encryption adds a lock. 
```

4. Why does the signature alone not prove which human used the private key?

```text
A valid signature does not prove that a specific human personally acted. It proves that the corresponding private key was used to sign the content. If another person had access to that 
private key, or if the key was compromised, the signature would still verify as valid. Custody of the private key is what makes a valid result meaningful.

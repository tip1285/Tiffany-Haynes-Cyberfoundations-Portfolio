# Week 8 Lab 03 — Meet Your Key Pair

**Student Name:** Tiffany Haynes

**Date Completed:** September 13, 2026

**Module:** 3 — Practical Cryptography  
**Submission Path:** `week-08/labs/lab-03-meet-your-key-pair.md`

> ## STOP — Protect secrets
> Never paste, upload, commit, or screenshot a password, passphrase, or private key. Do not run `cat` on any private-key file. Submit only the worksheet and the named screenshots. Keep all cryptographic files on the VM.

## How to Use This Lab

- **[TERMINAL]** means type or paste the command into the Cloud Heights terminal.
- **[WORKSHEET]** means type your response in this lab worksheet.
- Run commands in the order shown. Do not type the sample output.
- If your result does not match the stated success check, stop at the Troubleshooting box. Do not improvise with `sudo`, package installation, Azure settings, or SSH server configuration.

## Mission

Generate a dedicated Week 8 SSH key pair, identify its two files, and record the public-key fingerprint without exposing the private key.

## What You Already Know

The public and private keys have different jobs. The public key may be shared when appropriate. The private key stays under its owner's control. A key passphrase protects the private-key file; it is not the `analyst` account password.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
whoami
cf-week8-check
test ! -e ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519 &&   test ! -e ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub &&   echo "READY: Week 8 key path is unused" ||   echo "STOP: Week 8 key already exists"
```

**Continue only if:** `whoami` prints `analyst`, all checks report `PASS`, and the final line begins with `READY`.

If the final line begins with `STOP`, do not overwrite the key. Ask the instructor whether to resume with the existing key or use the approved reset.

### If the VM Stops

Return to **My Lab Environment** in the Lab Portal and start your assigned VM. A stopped or deallocated VM is not deleted; saved disk files remain.

## Predict First

**[WORKSHEET]** Which file can be distributed when appropriate: the public key or private key? Explain.

```text
The only file that can be distributed when appropriate is the public key. The private key must remain under the owner's sole and exclusive control.
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Prepare the SSH Directory

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

### Step 2 — Generate the Key Pair

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100   -f ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519   -C "week8-analyst-key"
```

At `Enter passphrase`, create a memorable Week 8 **key passphrase**. Type it again when asked. Nothing may appear while you type; this is normal. Do not use or enter the `analyst` account password unless it happens to be your deliberately chosen key passphrase.

### Step 3 — List the Two Key Files

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
ls -l ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519 ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub
```

**Expected result:** Two filenames appear. The file ending in `.pub` is public. The file without `.pub` is private.

**Evidence moment:** Capture only this listing as `week08-lab03-key-files-permissions.png`.

### Step 4 — Display the Public-Key Fingerprint

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub
```

**Expected result:** A line containing key size, a `SHA256:` fingerprint, the comment `week8-analyst-key`, and `ED25519`.

**Evidence moment:** Capture the fingerprint as `week08-lab03-public-key-fingerprint.png`.

## Stop & Check

Do not run `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`, or `nano` on `~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519`.

### Troubleshooting

- `Saving key ... failed`: confirm you are signed in as `analyst`; do not use `sudo`.
- `No such file` in Step 3 or 4: return to Step 2 and check whether key generation completed.
- Existing-key warning: answer `n` and contact the instructor. Never choose overwrite.

## Explain

**[WORKSHEET]** In 3–4 sentences, explain the handling difference between the two files and the purpose of the key passphrase.

```text
The public key file has the extension .pub which is safe to share. The private key-file is the file with no extension; therefore, it should not be shared (never committed, uploaded or staged anywhere). The purpose of the key passphrase is to protect or encrypt the private key-file on disk.
```

## Analysis Questions

1. Why can the public key be distributed while the private key must remain protected?

```text
The public is key is designed to be distributed whenever it is needed for an interaction. Sharing the public key is not a security risk. The private key however must remain under the owner's sole exclusive control.  The private key lives on the owner's system and is never uploaded, emailed, or pasted.
```

2. How is the key passphrase different from the `analyst` account password?

```text
The analyst account password is used to authenticate the account. The passphrase is an optional password that encrypts the private key file on disk. It protects the key file at rest, but it is not the private key itself, and it is not an account password.
```

3. Why did you use a unique Week 8 filename?

```text
The unique Week8 filename used .ssh, which is very particular about permissions. It lists the public keys permitted to authenticate for that account. Only the public key belongs in the authorized folder key.
```

# Week 7 Lab 03 — Build the Narrowest Door

**Student Name:** Tiffany Haynes

**Date Completed:** August 30, 2026

**Module:** 2 — Networking & Cloud Foundations | **Week:** 7  
**Submission Path:** `week-07/labs/lab-03-build-the-narrowest-door.md`

> ## Cloud Heights Protected-Rules Safety Rule
> Four baseline rules are protected: **100** (`allow-ssh-from-bastion`), **110** (`allow-icmp-intra-vnet`), **120** (`deny-ssh-student-subnet`), and **1000** (`deny-tcp8080-student-subnet` — Inbound Deny TCP from `10.60.6.0/26` to port `8080`). **You never modify, delete, replace, or use a protected rule as a troubleshooting target.** Create or edit student rules only in priorities **200–999**. The priority **1000** fallback deny sits after your band on purpose, so a narrower Allow you create in 200–999 is evaluated first. A mistake in your student range is recoverable and is not a grading penalty when you diagnose it honestly.

> **Evidence safety:** Never include a Cloud Heights password or Bastion shareable URL. Crop browser address bars and login information before committing screenshots.

## Mission

Run a temporary web service on TCP 8080 and create the least-privilege inbound rule: only Grid Beacon (`10.60.6.4`) may reach the service. You will predict the outcome before changing the ledger and verify the result afterward.

Your Allow at a student priority (recommended `300`) is evaluated **before** the protected priority **1000** `deny-tcp8080-student-subnet` fallback. So before you create the Allow, Grid Beacon's TCP 8080 traffic is denied by that priority 1000 fallback; after your narrow Allow exists and the listener is running, the same traffic is allowed because the lower priority number wins.

## What You Already Know

A network security rule is a decision about traffic. Rules are evaluated from the lowest priority number to the highest, and the first matching rule wins. Inbound and outbound traffic use separate ledgers. A configured service, a security rule, a test result, and an evidence screenshot answer different questions.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Service command | `python3 -m http.server 8080` |
| Allowed source | Grid Beacon — `10.60.6.4` |
| Test | Portal **Test My Rule**, fixed TCP 8080 |
| Time | 35–45 minutes |

- [x] I am using my assigned `cf-student-XX` VM through the CyberFoundations Lab Portal.

- [x] The VM shows **Running**.

- [x] I can identify the four protected baseline rules at priorities 100, 110, 120, and 1000.

- [x] I understand that my editable priority range is 200–999.

### Cloud Heights Idle Stop

Cloud Heights may warn you that the VM is idle. Return to the Lab Portal and choose **I'm still working** if you are active. If the VM is stopped or deallocated, it was not deleted: restart it from **My Lab Environment**. Your disk files and saved configuration remain.

## Predict First

Before starting the service or creating a rule, predict both conditions:

1. What verdict should Grid Beacon receive while no student Allow exists?
2. What verdict should it receive after the narrow Allow is created and the service is listening?
3. Which rule decides each case — your student Allow, or the protected priority 1000 fallback deny?

```text
1. If no student Allow exists the Grid Beacon should be denied access.
2. Once the narrow Allow is created and the service is listening, the Grid Beacon should be allowed to access the service.
3. In the first case, since no student Allow rule existed, the protected priority 1000 fallback deny rule is the rule that executed. The second case, the student Allow rule is the rule that executes.
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Start the Listener

Open the terminal on your assigned VM and run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

The terminal stays busy while the server runs. Leave it open. `Ctrl+C` stops it when the lab is complete.

### Step 2 — Stop & Check the Service State

Confirm the terminal shows that it is serving on port 8080. If the Portal later reports `SERVICE_NOT_LISTENING`, return here before changing rules.

### Step 3 — Create the Narrow Rule

In Security Rules, add one student rule with these values:

| Field | Required value |
|---|---|
| Name | `allow-grid-beacon-8080` (or a clearly equivalent name) |
| Priority | One unused value from 200–999; recommended `300` |
| Direction | Inbound |
| Action | Allow |
| Protocol | TCP |
| Source | `10.60.6.4` |
| Source port | Any |
| Destination | Your assigned VM / displayed default |
| Destination port | `8080` |
| Description | Week 7 least-privilege test service |

Do not broaden the source to the subnet or Any.

### Step 4 — Record the Change

```text
Name: allow-grid-beacon-8080
Priority: Priority 300
Fields: Direction (Inbound), Action (Allow), Protocol (TCP), Source (10.60.6.4), Source port (Any), Destination (10.60.6.33) Assigned VM, Destination port (8080), Description (Week 7 least-privilege test service)
```

## Test

Choose **Test My Rule**, select **Grid Beacon (10.60.6.4)**, and run the fixed TCP 8080 test. Wait at least 10 seconds before repeating a test.

Expected verdict: `ALLOWED`.

If you see `SERVICE_NOT_LISTENING`, the rule may be correct but the Python listener is not running. If you see `TEST_ERROR`, verify the VM is running, wait 10 seconds, and retry once before requesting support.

## Capture Evidence

Capture the completed narrow rule and the Grid Beacon `ALLOWED` result. The images must show the source and destination port clearly.

## Explain

Explain why allowing one source to one TCP port is narrower than allowing the whole subnet or Any source, even though all three might make the intended test pass.

```text
Allowing Any source to one TCP port means that any source can have access. Allowing the whole subnet 10.60.6.0/24 admits any source whose address falls within the subnet. Only allowing source 10.60.6.4 (Grid Beacon) to one TCP port is narrower than allowing Any and the whole subnet. All three can pass the same positive test.
```

## Required Evidence

Save screenshots in `assets/screenshots/week-07/`:

- `week07-lab03-rule-created.png`
- `week07-lab03-beacon-allowed.png`

Open each image at full size before submission. Confirm that no password, Bastion shareable URL, browser address bar, or unrelated private information is visible.

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** The Python service and the NSG rule perform different jobs. What does each one control? (Minimum 3 sentences.)

```text
The NSG or Network Security Group is the firewall. The firewall evaluates if network traffic is allowed to pass through a protective boundary based on a specific set of instructions. The firewall can either allow or deny traffic. The Python service is the server that you are trying to connect to or reach. In order to reach the Python service you first have to get through the NSG. 
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Why is `10.60.6.4` a stronger source value than Any for this task? (Minimum 4 sentences.)

```text
10.60.6.4 is a stronger source value than Any, because you're using the least privilege concept. You open the narrowest door but still allow the required traffic. Any opens up to have traffic come from any source which can potentially turn into a security breach. Using Any as the source, you have unconstrained traffic flow with high overhead and noise. By using 10.60.6.4, you have targeted traffic which comes with maximum efficiency. 
```

**Analysis Question 3.** What does an `ALLOWED` result prove, and what does it not prove about other sources? (Minimum 3 sentences.)

```text
An ALLOWED result proved that the rule is functioning or works, but the result was for the Grid Beacon (10.60.6.4) only. For other sources, it does not prove whether or not they will get the same ALLOWED result. It also doesn't prove if the rule and/or connection is secure or not.
```

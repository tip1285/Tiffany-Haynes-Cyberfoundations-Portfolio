> ### 🔒 Cloud Heights Security Rule
> Your Bastion link and Cloud Heights password are **private access credentials**. Never paste either into a worksheet, screenshot, GitHub repository, Circle post, or chat message. When taking screenshots, crop out the browser address bar and all login information.

## Overview

Week 5 was practice. This week the machine is real. Cloud Heights is a live Ubuntu 22.04 server running in Azure, and one of its rooms has **already been reserved for you** — you do not create it, provision it, or pay for it. Your job in this lab is to walk in the front door, prove you are standing inside your own room, and understand where that room came from.

This is a **guided** lab. Every step tells you what to do and what to record. Expect 30–40 minutes.

---

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | Cloud Heights — live Ubuntu 22.04 VM in Azure, reached through Azure Bastion in your browser |
| Access | Lab Portal → **My Lab Environment** → your Cloud Heights card |
| Username | `analyst` |
| Password | Provided to you separately. Never typed into this worksheet. |
| Commands used | `hostname`, `whoami`, `pwd` |
| Auto-shutdown | Your VM stops automatically after 15 minutes of inactivity. A warning with **Keep Working** appears first. |

**Before you start:** open **My Lab Environment** in the Portal. If your VM shows **Stopped**, click **Start VM** and wait until the status reads **Running** — this takes a minute or two. Only then click **Open Cloud Heights**.

---

## Part A — Walking In

### Step 1 — Start the Room

In **My Lab Environment**, check your Cloud Heights status. Start the VM if it is stopped and wait for **Running**.

The status you saw before you started, and the status you saw after:

```
Status before starting VM: The status shows unknown

Status after starting VM: The status shows running
```

### Step 2 — Open Cloud Heights and Sign In

Click **Open Cloud Heights**. A browser-based session opens through Azure Bastion. Sign in with username `analyst` and the password you were given separately.

**Do not record the password, the link, or any part of the login screen anywhere.**

Describe what you saw once the session opened — what kind of screen greeted you:

```
The screen looks similar to the Windows command prompt screen which is a black screen with white letters/wording.
```

### Step 3 — Ask the Machine Its Name

Run:
```
hostname
```
Output:

```
cf-student-14
```

### Step 4 — Ask Who You Are

Run:
```
whoami
```
Output:

```
analyst
```

### Step 5 — Ask Where You Are Standing

Run:
```
pwd
```
Output:

```
/home/analyst
```

## Part B — What Those Three Answers Prove

### Step 1 — Read Them as Evidence

Each of those three commands answered a different question: *which machine*, *which identity*, *which location in the filesystem*. Together they are the proof that you are inside your own room and not somebody else's.

Explain, in your own words, what each output proves:

```
The hostname command tells you the machine that you are, the whoami command tells you what account or username is using the machine, and the pwd command tells you what folder you're located in.
```

### Step 2 — Capture Your Evidence

Take a screenshot of your terminal showing the three commands and their outputs.

**Required filename:** `bastion-session.png`

**Crop rules — not optional.** The screenshot must show the terminal and prompt. It must **not** show the browser address bar, the Bastion link, any login screen, or any password field. Crop before you upload.

Upload it to `assets/screenshots/week-06/` in your portfolio repository, then paste its link here:

## Part C — Where Your Room Came From

### Step 1 — The Golden Image Idea

Every student's Cloud Heights room was built from the **same standardized image** — a known-good snapshot of a configured Ubuntu machine. Nobody hand-built 20 servers. One machine was configured correctly once, captured, and stamped out repeatedly.

Explain in your own words what a standardized (golden) image is and why an organization would build one:

```
A Golden image is a template prepared carefully and is used to create identical machines. It's only created once but used multiple times to create consistent identical machines. An organization would build one if they are building virtual machines and wanted each machine to be identical. 
```

### Step 2 — Same Start, Different Rooms

Your room started identical to everyone else's, and from today it starts to diverge as you work in it.

Explain what stays the same across all the rooms and what becomes yours alone:

```
The room itself is what becomes mine alone due to least privilege. The thing that will stay the same across all rooms are the resources: compute size and disk.
```

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** Why does it matter that a standardized image can be *restored*, not just deployed? Describe a realistic situation where restoring from a known-good image is the fastest safe fix. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
Let's say you got an email from an unknown source, and you decide to click/download an attachment within that email. Unbeknownst to you, that attachment contains malware and it completely wipes out the data on your computer. Before clicking on that email, a golden image was taken of your machine. A golden image is a template to create identical machines. That golden image can be used to restore your machine back to its original state before the incident took place.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Conceptually, how is a snapshot different from a separate backup? Consider what each one protects against and where each one lives. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
A snapshot is a copy of a moment or a point in time. A snapshot protects you from your own last change. A backup is a separate copy of data, which survives the loss of the original. A backup protects you from losing everything after an entire storage system fails.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Your room was reserved for you rather than created by you. What does that tell you about how cloud access is usually handed out in a real organization, and why would an employer prefer that model? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
An employer would prefer to create the VMs on their own and give it to the employees since they would have control over what specifications that VM needed. The employer can better control costs if they created the VMs versus the employees. Plus, if all employees were given the opportunity to create their own VM, then there wouldn't be any consistency amongst the employees.
```

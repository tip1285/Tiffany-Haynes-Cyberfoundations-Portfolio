# Week 6 Notes — Cloud Heights: Cloud VMs, SSH, VNets & Layers

**Student Name:** Tiffany Haynes

**Date Completed:** 8/23/2026

Summarize this week's key concepts in your own words — not copy-pasted definitions. This week moved from the simulated Grid into a real cloud environment, so focus on what you personally observed as well as what each term means.

> **Cloud Heights Security Rule:** Your Bastion shareable link and Cloud Heights password are private access credentials. Never paste either into this file, a screenshot, your GitHub repository, Circle, or a chat message.

## Key Concepts This Week

- **Cloud** — other people's computers, professionally operated and reached over a network
- **Datacenter** — the physical facility where cloud computing equipment lives
- **Region** — a geographic area where a cloud provider operates datacenters
- **Virtual machine (VM)** — a computer created in software; in Cloud Heights, your VM runs on hardware in a real datacenter
- **IaaS / PaaS / SaaS** — different levels of cloud service: rent the room, rent the workshop, or rent the finished service
- **Shared responsibility model** — the cloud provider secures the building and underlying platform; the customer is still responsible for what belongs to them
- **Provisioning** — creating and preparing a resource so it is ready to use
- **Golden image / snapshot** — a known starting point that can be used to create consistent machines
- **Snapshot vs backup** — a snapshot is a point-in-time copy used for recovery or cloning; a backup is a separate recovery copy with a different purpose
- **Azure Bastion** — the guarded front desk that gives you browser-based SSH access without giving your VM a public IP
- **Bastion shareable link** — sensitive access information that must never be committed to GitHub or exposed in screenshots
- **SSH (Secure Shell)** — remote command-line access to another machine
- **SSH client and server** — the client starts the connection; the server listens and answers
- **Port 22** — the standard numbered door used by SSH
- **Host / fingerprint verification** — the verify-before-approve habit when connecting to a host for the first time
- **Authentication** — proving that you are the account you claim to be
- **Remote session / remote shell** — the live command-line session running on another machine
- **Getting TO vs getting INTO a machine** — network reachability and authentication are different problems
- **`hostname`** — asks which machine you are on
- **`whoami`** — asks which account you are using
- **`pwd`** — asks where you are in the filesystem
- **Private IP address** — an address used inside a private network rather than directly on the public internet
- **Virtual network (VNet)** — the private cloud neighborhood where resources communicate
- **Subnet** — a smaller address range inside a VNet; a floor inside the larger building
- **NAT / outbound translation** — lets a privately addressed machine communicate outward without giving the machine its own public IP
- **Network Security Group (NSG)** — the network guard post that controls what traffic is allowed; you take control of these rules in Week 7
- **Known-good reference point** — a target whose expected behavior gives you something reliable to compare against
- **Grid Beacon** — the known-good Cloud Heights host at `10.60.6.4`
- **The silent Azure gateway** — Azure's default gateway may not answer ICMP ping even when the network is healthy
- **OSI model** — the seven-layer vocabulary used to organize network and application behavior
- **TCP/IP model** — the more compact layer model commonly used by practitioners
- **Layers** — a way to separate different jobs in a communication path so troubleshooting can be systematic
- **Encapsulation** — information travelling inside other information, like a letter inside an envelope inside a mailbag
- **The Ladder Rule in the real cloud** — work outward, prove what works, use the route and a known-good target, and never let one silent tool response choose the culprit by itself

## My Cloud Heights Command Table

You used these commands on a real Ubuntu machine this week. Instead of memorizing syntax, write down the **question each command answers** or the job it performs.

| Command | What question does it answer / what does it do? |
| --- | --- |
| `hostname` | which machine am I on? |
| `whoami` | which account am I using? |
| `pwd` | where am I in the file? |
| `ip addr` | what addresses are assigned to this machine? |
| `ip route` | where does this machine send traffic that isn't local? |
| `ping` | is the target answering ICMP? |
| `traceroute` | what path does traffic take? |
| `dig` | what address is behind this name? |
| `curl` | is the application actually answering? |
| `ssh` | how do I securely log into a remote computer? |
| `exit` | did the last command succeed or fail? |

## In My Own Words

### 1. Getting TO vs Getting INTO

Explain the difference between getting **TO** a machine and getting **INTO** a machine. Use something you personally observed in Cloud Heights as evidence.

```
Get to the machine means reaching the actual machine. For example, in Cloud Heights getting through the Guard or NSG is getting to the machine. Getting into the machine means that you have to prove who you are and by providing your credentials to access the VM.
```

### 2. The Silent Gateway

Your Azure gateway did not answer `ping`, but your VM was still healthy. Explain how you proved the network was working and what this taught you about interpreting tool output.

```
Things that I used to proved that the network was working even though ping did not answer:
1)I pinged the Grid Beacon at 10.60.6.4 sits within the same subnet as the VM 10.60.6.0/26. Evidence shows that I was able to reach the Grid Beacon which means there was local-subnet connectivity. 
2)I ran the command ip route it proved that I had a default route configured. All non-local traffic should be routed to 10.60.6.1 the gateway.
3)The VM is able to reach an IP outside of the subnet which was enabled through the use of NAT. The private address of the VM was converted to a public address which is used to connect to the internet; therefore, off-subnet connectivity was successful.

This taught me a lesson about how things are configured sometimes will produce a default output. The ping was ICMP but it was trying to access a SSH via port 22, which will not answer by default.
```

### 3. Private on the Inside, Connected to the Outside

Explain how your Cloud Heights VM can reach the internet even though it has only a private IP address. Then explain how **you** reach the VM from outside its VNet.

```
Traffic moves through two deliberately different paths, inbound and outbound. Inbound, you arrive at the guarded front desk — Azure Bastion — which is the only way in. Outbound, your machine reaches the internet through NAT at the loading dock: the platform swaps your private address for a shared public one on the way out. 
```

### 4. VNet vs Subnet

Explain the difference between a VNet and a subnet using the Cloud Heights building/floor analogy. Then explain why separating systems into smaller network ranges can help security.

```
The VNet is the virtual network or the building in Cloud Heights. The Subnet is a small portion of the VNet and is broken down into sections called floors. A subnet is a security decision, and separating into smaller network ranges limits how far a problem can travel. That limitation helps security with isolating a problem, making sure it doesn't spread to other areas.
```

### 5. The Ladder Rule Has a Map Now

The Ladder Rule never used the words OSI or TCP/IP. Explain how the layer models give you a map for the same troubleshooting process you have already been using.

```
The ladder rule process: 1. check yourself 2. check your gateway 3. check the name 4. check the IP 5. trace the path. The layer models give you a map for the same troubleshooting process in the ladder rule by giving you a visual of what happens at each level. Just like the ladder rule the layer models start from the bottom and work up until the problem is reached. 
```

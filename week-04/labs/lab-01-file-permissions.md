# Week 4 Lab — File Permissions: The Badge Audit (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** Tiffany Haynes

**Date Completed:** 8/6/2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 4  
**Submission Path:** `week-04/labs/lab-01-file-permissions.md`

## Overview

Lesson 1 revealed what Ivy's badge rings mean: every file carries permissions — who may read, write, and execute it — and one wrongly-set ring can be a whole security incident. This lab has you run a small permissions audit of your own in the CLI Simulator: read the rings on a set of seeded files (Part A), fix three problems deliberately with `chmod` (Part B), and read the same story on the Windows side with `Get-Acl` (Part C). One screenshot from this lab becomes part of ★ Deliverable 1.

**Nothing here can break anything real.** The CLI Simulator is a consequence-free practice space — exactly the right place to change permissions for the first time.

---

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) — no install, no VM, no real terminal required |
| Shell | Parts A and B use **bash**; Part C uses **PowerShell** |
| Prerequisite | Week 4, Lesson 1 completed |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 4 → CLI Simulator**, and find the **"Foundry District Badge Office"** scenario. You'll see two entries in the list: **Badge Office — Bash** (used for Parts A and B) and **Badge Office — PowerShell** (used for Part C). Start with the Bash one. It seeds a small folder of files whose permissions have… issues. That's the point.

---

## Part A — Read the Rings

### Step 1 — Get the Security Report

Run the long listing (`ls -l`) in your starting folder. This is the same listing from Week 3's `ls`, with one flag added — and that flag turns it into a per-file security report.

Command you ran:

```
ls -l
```

Output (the full listing):

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
-rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 shift-notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    49 supply-list.txt
```

### Step 2 — Decode One File Completely

Pick any one file from your listing and decode its full permission string, audience by audience — owner, group, other — the way Lesson 1 decoded `-rwxr-xr--`. Write it as plain-English sentences ("the owner can…, the group can…, everyone else can…").

The file and its permission string:

```
The shift-notes.txt file: (-rw-r--r--) 

```

Your plain-English decode:

```
The shift-notes.txt file the owner has permissions to read and write.
The shift-notes.txt file the group has permissions to read the file. 
Everyone else has permission to read the shift-notes.txt file.
```

### Step 3 — Find the Problem File

One file in this folder is dramatically more permissive than it should be — every ring lit for every audience, or close to it. Find it. (Hint: scan the *other* triplet — the last three characters — down the whole listing. Which file gives strangers the most?)

The most permissive file and why you flagged it:

```
master-inventory.txt file gives the owner, the group and everyone else permission to read and write. I flagged the master-inventory.txt file since others (everyone else) usually don't have the permission to write.
```

## Part B — Change the Rings

This is your first time changing permissions, so we follow THE GATEKEEPER'S RULE on every single change: **check who can touch it now, change it, then check again.** That means `ls -l` before *and after* every `chmod`. The simulator's checklist will verify this — a change without both checks will not pass.

### Step 1 — Lock Down the Problem File

The problem file from Part A, Step 3 should not be writable by the group or by other. Fix it: revoke write from group (`g-w`), then revoke both read and write from other. Run `ls -l` before your first change and after your last one.

Commands you ran (in order, including both ls -l checks):

```
ls -l
chmod g-w master-inventory.txt
ls -l
chmod o-rw master-inventory.txt
ls -l
```

The file's permission string BEFORE and AFTER:

```
(Before chmod g-w master-inventory.txt)
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
-rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 shift-notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    49 supply-list.txt

After chmod g-w master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
-rw-r--rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 shift-notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    49 supply-list.txt

Before chmod o-rw master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
-rw-r--rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 shift-notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    49 supply-list.txt

After chmod o-rw master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
-rw-r----- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 shift-notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    49 supply-list.txt
```

### Step 2 — Make a Script Runnable

The scenario seeds a script (its name ends in `.sh`) that its owner cannot currently execute. Grant the owner execute — and only the owner. Verify with `ls -l` after.

Commands you ran:

```
chmod u+x cleanup.sh
ls -l
```

Output (the script's corrected permission string):

```
-rwxr--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
```

### Step 3 — Protect the Secrets File

There's a file whose name makes clear it shouldn't be readable by everyone. Revoke other's read. Verify.

Commands you ran:

```
ls -l
chmod o-r badge-codes.txt
ls -l
```

Output (the corrected permission string):

```
-rw-r----- 1 
```

### Step 4 — Capture Your Audit Evidence (REQUIRED screenshot)

**Read this first — it will save you some confusion.** Every challenge in the CLI Simulator hands you a **fresh copy** of the Badge Office folder. That's deliberate: each challenge is its own clean exercise. You'll see `(fresh filesystem for this challenge)` on the divider line each time. It also means your fixes from earlier challenges will *not* still be showing when you reach the last one. Nothing you did was undone, and nothing you did was wrong — the folder was simply reset.

So build your evidence listing **inside the last challenge**. Apply all three fixes there, one after another, then run one final `ls -l`:

```
chmod g-w master-inventory.txt
chmod o-rw master-inventory.txt
chmod u+x cleanup.sh
chmod o-r badge-codes.txt
ls -l
```

That one listing shows all three fixes together — that's your evidence. Take a screenshot of your simulator session showing it. **This screenshot is required — it is part of ★ Deliverable 1.** Name it `cli-permissions-audit.png`. You'll upload and embed it in the GitHub Commit section below.

## Part C — The Same Story, Windows Edition

### Step 1 — Read One File's Guest List

Switch to the PowerShell side of the scenario and run `Get-Acl` on the seeded file the scenario panel points you to. Windows shows a *list* of named accounts and rights instead of three ring-triplets.

Command you ran:

```
Get-Acl shift-notes.txt
```

Output (the owner line and at least one access entry):

```
Path : shift-notes.txt
Owner : morgan
Access : -rw-r--r--
```

### Step 2 — Translate One Entry

Take one access entry from your output and translate it into plain English, the same way you decoded the Linux string in Part A.

Your plain-English translation:

```
Morgan the owner of the file shift-notes.txt has the permission to read and write.
The group has permission to read the file shift-notes.txt.
Others have permission to read the file shift-notes.txt.
```

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part A you found the problem file by scanning the *other* triplet. Why is the "other" audience usually the most important one to audit first on a shared system? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
The other audience usually doesn't have permission to do anything with the file except read the file or no permission at all. Giving others more permission than they need can actually be a vulnerability.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** THE GATEKEEPER'S RULE requires a check before *and* after every change, even though `chmod` rarely fails. What does the *before* check protect you from, and what does the *after* check protect you from? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
The before check verifies who can touch the file now. The after check is to make sure the change was actually executed.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Lesson 1 called least privilege "granting what's needed and revoking the rest." Pick one of your three fixes from Part B and explain it in least-privilege terms: what was granted that wasn't needed, and who could have taken advantage? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
Originally the permissions were set to -rw-rw-rw- for the master-inventory.txt file. The owner had permission to read and write which didn't change because that was necessary for the owner to manage the file. The group was originally granted permission to read and write but that was changed to read only. Everyone else was granted the permission to read and write and those permissions were completely taken away since there was no need for them to do either with the file. The others could have taken advantage of the extra permissions to read and write.
```

**Analysis Question 4.** Windows ACLs can name specific people; Linux permissions use three fixed audiences. Describe one situation where the Windows approach would be genuinely more useful — and one cost of that extra flexibility. *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
Windows ACLs could be useful if you have a situation where you needed to verify the name of everyone who can access a particular file. If everyone who can access the file is listed, then a potential downfall or security threat is that an attacker can get access to that list. 
```

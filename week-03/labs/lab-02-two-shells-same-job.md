# Week 3 Lab 02 — Two Shells, Same Job: Incident Response Edition (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** Tiffany Haynes

**Date Completed:** 8/2/2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 3  
**Submission Path:** `week-03/labs/lab-02-two-shells-same-job.md`

## Overview

Welcome to your first Incident Response (IR) assignment in the **Foundry District Storeroom**. Our network monitoring system has flagged a potential unauthorized file access attempt on our storage systems, and you've been asked to investigate from two angles: first by connecting to a remote Linux database server (Pass A, in bash), then by sitting down at a Windows admin workstation examining that exact same shared storage (Pass B, in PowerShell). Your goal is to confirm the files look the same from both operating systems and that the directory tree matches — the same translation skill from Lesson 2, now applied to a real-feeling scenario instead of just a comparison slide. You'll also log your own findings along the way, using the create-and-organize commands from Lesson 3C — a real investigator never just looks and remembers, they document.

**Nothing here can break anything real.** Same consequence-free CLI Simulator as Lab 01.

## 💡 Pro-Tips for Reducing Keyboard Strain

Before you start typing, remember these three professional efficiency "cheat codes":

- **Tab Completion (the autocomplete magic):** you don't need to type out long folder names — type the first few letters (e.g., `cd rep`) and press **Tab**. The shell will instantly autocomplete the folder name, in both bash and PowerShell.
- **Up Arrow (the recaller):** if you make a typo, don't retype the whole command — press the **Up Arrow** to recall your last command, use the left/right arrows to fix the typo, and hit **Enter**.
- **PowerShell aliases:** if typing `Get-Location` or `Get-ChildItem` feels too long, PowerShell lets you use `pwd` as a shortcut for location, and `ls` or `dir` for listing files.

## Part A — The Bash Pass (Linux Remote Server)

Connect to the **remote Linux terminal** in the CLI Simulator and execute the following investigative steps. Record your commands and output exactly as they appear.

### Step A1 — Verify Your Starting Location

Run the command to print your current working directory.

Command you ran:

```
pwd
```

Output:

```
/home/agent
```

### Step A2 — Look Around the Directory

List the contents of your current location to spot any files or folders.

Command you ran:

```
ls
```

Output:

```
README.txt   archive

```

### Step A3 — Move Deeper into the Storeroom

Choose a folder from the list and use the change directory command to move inside it.

Command you ran:

```
cd archive
```

**⚠️ Stop and check:** run your location-check command *immediately* after moving, to confirm you arrived safely.

Command you ran:

```
pwd
```

Output:

```
/home/agent/archive
```

### Step A4 — Inspect the Incident Log File

Find a text file in this directory and print its contents to the screen to peek inside.

Command you ran:

```
cat access-log.txt
```

Output:

```
Access Log- Incident 42
03:14 - Unknown login attempt, storeroom bay 3.
03:16 - Access denied.
03:17 - Alert raised to on-call
```

### Step A5 — Create Your Investigation Note

Investigators document as they go. Create a new, empty file right here called `investigation-notes.txt` to hold your findings.

Command you ran:

```
touch investigation-notes.txt
```

### Step A6 — Back Up Your Note

Before you go any further, make a backup copy of `investigation-notes.txt` called `investigation-notes-backup.txt`, in case anything happens to your original.

Command you ran:

```
cp investigation-notes.txt investigation-notes-bakcup.txt
```

Confirm both files now exist:

```
Both files exist (investigation-nlsotes-backup.txt & investigation-notes.txt) including the access-log.txt
```

## Part B — The PowerShell Pass (Windows Admin Workstation)

Now switch your simulator tab to **PowerShell**. You are examining the same shared storage room from a Windows administrative workstation. **You must target the exact same folder and file you used in Part A.**

### Step B1 — Verify Your Starting Location

Run the Windows command to print your current location.

Command you ran:

```
Get-Location
```

Output:

```
/home/agent
```

### Step B2 — Look Around the Directory

List the contents of your current location.

Command you ran:

```
Get-ChildItem
```

Output:

```
archive   README.txt
```

### Step B3 — Move Deeper into the Storeroom

Move into the **exact same folder** you chose in Part A.

Command you ran:

```
Set-Location archive
```

**⚠️ Stop and check:** run your location-check command *immediately* after moving, to confirm you arrived safely.

Command you ran:

```
Get-Location
```

Output:

```
/home/agent/archive
```

### Step B4 — Inspect the Incident Log File

Print the contents of the **exact same text file** you read in Part A.

Command you ran:

```
Get-Content access-log.txt
```

Output:

```
Access log-Incident 42
03:14 - Unknown login attempt, storeroom bay 3.
03:16 - Access denied.
03:17 - Alert raised to on-call.
```

### Step B5 — Create Your Investigation Note

Create the **same-named** empty file, `investigation-notes.txt`, right here on the Windows side.

Command you ran:

```
New-Item investigation-notes.txt
```

### Step B6 — Back Up Your Note

Make a backup copy of `investigation-notes.txt` called `investigation-notes-backup.txt`, same as you did in Part A.

Command you ran:

```
Copy-Item investigation-notes.txt investigation-notes-backup.txt
```

Confirm both files now exist:

```
Mode                Name
-a----             access-log.txt
-a----             investigation-notes-backup.txt
-a----             investigation-notes.txt
```

## Part C — Side-by-Side Comparison (Spot the Difference)

### Step C1 — The Command Comparison Table

Fill in the exact commands you typed for each task. Do not use generic names — list what you actually executed.

| Task / Question | Bash Command (Linux Pass) | PowerShell Command (Windows Pass) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Where am I? | pwd | Get-Location |
| 2. Look around | ls | Get-ChildItem |
| 3. Move into a folder | cd | Set-Location |
| 4. Peek inside a file | cat | Get-Content |
| 5. Create + back up your note | cp | Copy-Item |

**⚠️ Stop and check:** did you use the exact same folder and file for both your bash and PowerShell passes? If they don't match, your comparison table below won't make sense — go back to Part B and re-target the same location before continuing.

### Step C2 — Output Differences Reflection

Describe at least one difference in how the two shells presented information to you (e.g., column layout, text colors, file details, folder headers). Minimum 2 sentences.

```
One difference I noticed between the two shells (Bash & PowerShell) is that the layout of the contents when you run the ls command is that Bash lists everything horizontally and PowerShell lists everything in a column format. Also, when running the ls command in PowerShell the contents have a mode and Bash contents didn't have a mode.
```

## 🧠 Analysis Questions

### Analysis Question 1 — The Identical Tree

How do you know that the underlying file system tree was identical across both passes, even though you used completely different commands and operating systems? Point to concrete evidence from your terminal outputs (e.g., matching folder names, file content, or sizes). Minimum 3 sentences.

```
The file system tree was identical in both Shells, if you follow the path from the root all the way down to the text files everything was the same. They both had the same exact folders (agent, archive). The contents of the Access log incident-42 text file were identical. 
```

### Analysis Question 2 — Syntax Preferences

Which command pair (e.g., pwd vs. Get-Location, ls vs. dir, cat vs. type) felt most different to you? Give a specific reason why one felt more comfortable or intuitive than the other. Minimum 3 sentences.

```
The pwd vs. Get-Location commands felt the most comfortable since they were the easiest commands in my opinion to remember between both Shells. The pair ls vs. dir is another command pair that felt fairly easy to remember. The last pair cat vs. type I kept forgetting that you had to have an argument behind those commands. 
```

### Analysis Question 3 — Applying Lesson 2 Differences

Describe how a specific difference you learned about in Lesson 2 (such as slash styles, case-sensitivity, or drive letters) was directly visible in your hands-on commands or output during this lab. Minimum 3 sentences.

```
I know in Lesson 2 we learned that a Windows path has a back slash\ and the Linux paths have a forward slash, but I didn't see the backslash for the Windows (PowerShell) output just the forward slash. The case-sensitivity was evident when trying to execute a command in Bash, an error message will indicate that the file/folder doesn't exist. I didn't see the \ in the output for the Windows (PowerShell) output but I did see the forward slash for the Bash output. 
```
